### Internal Changes

- Add Actions for deploying documentation static website.
- Published Documentation static website on GitHub Pages.

## [2.6.1] - 2024-02-25

### Added

- Add `UnityEventBatchBinder` that binds multiple GameEvents into `UnityEvent`.

### Changed

- Mark `GameEventCollection` as Obsolete.
- Fix refactoring file rename leak.
- Fix unexpected behavior when editor's domain reload is disabled.
- Rename `RequestResponseEventUniTaskSample` and its contents to `TransactionUniTaskSample`.

### Removed

- Removed `SaveAndRefreshHelper`. It is considered unnecessary and can be a heavy process on larger project.

### Changed

- Add `Transaction` as a replacement to `RequestResponseEvent` for naming purpose.
- Mark `RequestResponseEvent` as Obsolete.
- Rename `RequestResponseEvent` sample into `Transaction` sample.

## [2.5.10] - 2023-09-26

### Changed

- Add null check on `CollectionCore`

## [2.5.9] - 2023-06-12

### Changed

- Fixed `Collection<TKey, TValue>` which does not `Clear()` properly.

## [2.5.8] - 2023-06-01

### Changed

- Removed debug log from `VariableCore`

### Changed

- Fixed token handling and disposal of Reactive Properties on UniTask's `RequestResponseEvent` .
- Fixed json not loaded when loading on Awake/Start.
- Fixed (hack) `VariableCore`'s `autoResetValue` on Class type due to shallow copy. Since this is a hack, it is better to avoid `autoResetValue` on class type and try to use `struct` instead.

## [2.5.6] - 2023-04-28

### Changed

- Update `Collection` value subscription index when inserting an element.

## [2.5.5] - 2023-04-27

### Changed

- Removed redundant code.
- Null and loop check.

## [2.5.4] - 2023-04-27

### Changed

- Fixed unnecessary `GameEvent` Raise on Inspector code.
- Attempt to improve ScriptableObjects' lifetime event handling.
- Expose RequestResponseEvent's `RequestAsObservable`, `ResponseAsObservable`, `RequestAsAsyncEnumerable`, and `ResponseAsAsyncEnumerable`.

- Disposal handling and other minor performance improvement attempt.

## [2.5.3] - 2023-03-28

### Changed

## [2.5.2] - 2023-03-18

### Added

- Editor-Only Json File Operation in Inspector for Kassets' Variable derived Instances.
- Log feedback when raising event from Inspector.

### Changed

- Command's `Execute()` is now abstract on UniTask version and `ExecuteAsync()` is now virtual (which calls `Execute()` by default).
- Fixed missing extension when checking existence of json file.
- Removed some sample's dependency from UniRx.
- removed `InstanceSettings` as a class and use them as individual field. This prevents 'GameEvent' to have unecessary settings for 'Variable'.
  - `CAUTION` : as Unity Serialization lose access to `instanceSettings` field, the settings for existing instances will reset.

## [2.5.1] - 2023-02-25

### Changed

- Fixed Editor Extension Custom Drawer to display properly when viewed over a Component.
- Json Extension Utility will convert custom types in root level without "value" label.

### Added

- Sample for `KassetsJsonExtension` utility.

### Changed

- Fixed Editor Drawer compilation error on Unity 2020.3.

- Added Non-Generic interface `IVariable` for Variable Systems.
- Json Extension Utility now use interface `IVariable<T>` as parameter instead of `VariableCore<T>`.
- Added Experimental feature on Json Extension Utility which use IVariable as parameter. This allows conversion to/from json string using reflection without knowing variable's generic type. Please use with care.

## [2.4.3] - 2022-10-26

### Changed
- Added `AsObservable()` and `AsAsyncEnumerable()` when both `UniRx` and `UniTask` exists together.
- Minor improvement and code formatting on editor code.
- Note : Updated minimum Unity version to 2020.1 due to some `C#` formatting.

## [2.4.2] - 2022-10-25

### Changed
- Fixed timing of entering play mode (use ExitingEditMode instead) which were used for `AutoResetValue` timing.

## [2.4.1] - 2022-10-24

### Added
- `QuaternionCollection`
- `PoseCollection`
- `InstanceSettings`: Grouped kassets instance's settings (i.e. Variable event type) into one class.

### Changed
- Fixed wrong type of `Vector3Collection`, from `Vector2` to the correct `Vector3`.
- Fixed conditionals (Scripting Define) on UniTask Samples.
- Improve Custom Editor code (Custom class no longer show "Value" dropdown).
